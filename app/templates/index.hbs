<h2>Engineering and User Experience Leader</h2>
    <p><img src="../images/sarah_pro.jpg" alt="Sarah Clatterbuck Photo" class="inline-img"/> I am a seasoned engineering leader who is passionate about fantastic design and user experience. My technical expertise is in UI development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with a variety of server-side technologies used in my 15 year career as a technologist. More recently, I started exploring native mobile development and have contributed several features to our iOS codebase at LinkedIn. I have been leading technology teams since 2004 and my current organization is 60 developers strong.</p>
    <p>I am serious in my dedication to the craft of development. I love simple, clean, testable, and re-usable code. I like to leave the things I touch better and more maintainable than when I found them. Knowing that a well-crafted user interface meets the needs of all users, I am passionate about accessibility, security, performance and internationalization.</p>
    <p>As a leader, I love boring technologies that just work. I see technology in service to the product that is being created. As long as I can bend an existing technology to meet the demands of the product, I will avoid re-writing. Once that is no longer the case, I am happy to advocate for a re-write, preferably in one layer at a time.</p>
    <p>As a developer, I love to try out new technologies - mostly on my weekend time. I have the maturity to know when to introduce these technologies into the enterprise and when to keep them as a hobby. This matches with my personal interest in both athletics and adventure travel where I love to push out of my comfort zone, take risks, and learn new things. And yet, I avoid risks that have a higher than average likelihood of death. Live to the fullest, but keep living.</p>
    <p>As a leader, I am dedicated to increasing the diversity of the technical workforce. Diverse teams build better products that reach a wider audience. As such, I dedicate 20% of my time to the LinkedIn Women in Tech initiative, along with sitting on the board of the Girl Scouts of Northern California. For the Girl Scouts, I am working on STEM strategy and technical programming. I personally have mentored a group of high school girls from East Palo Alto since 2012 starting with the Technovation Challenge. And, I spend time mentoring several colleagues. Another part of my interest in diversity is ensuring that designers and engineers learn to create products that meet the needs of users with differing abilities. This aligns with our company vision to create economic opportunity for the entire global workforce. To that end, I started the Accessibility Task Force at LinkedIn and contribute code enhancements on an ongoing basis.</p>
